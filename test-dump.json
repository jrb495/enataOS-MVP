  "dump": "Visited Haus of Face this morning. Dr. Lynn mentioned that her Xeomin patients are starting to ask about other options — she’s not happy with how quickly it's wearing off. I introduced Daxxify and explained the longer duration, which caught her attention. She asked about training opportunities and whether we had a loyalty or incentive program. I told her about the SPIFF this quarter and left two vials to try. Her assistant seemed supportive but said the switch would need to be fast, since they have an open house event next Thursday. Dr. Lynn asked if I could send training materials by Monday and seemed genuinely interested in trying something new."
