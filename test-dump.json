  "dump": "Stopped by Canvas Med Spa today. Dr. Morgan mentioned that her Botox patients are coming back sooner than expected — she's frustrated with the duration. I explained how Daxxify could offer a longer result and she seemed intrigued, especially for her younger patients. She asked how it compares to Xeomin, which she currently uses because of pricing. I left two vials of Daxxify for her to try. Her assistant Olivia seemed skeptical about the change — said they'd need more training and that the price difference might be a hard sell internally. Dr. Morgan asked if there was any bundled training or loyalty program. I mentioned our SPIFF that's running this quarter and she said she’d think about it. Before I left, she said 'Let me know if you can get me something by next Thursday, we’re doing a big event.' Definitely felt like good momentum, but pricing is still a concern."
